.SH DESCRIPTION
When the kernel module parameter \fBdahdi.auto_assign_span\fR is unset,
DAHDI devices (such as DAHDI PCI cards) that register with DAHDI don't
register their spans (e.g.: each digital port is normally a span) with
DAHDI. This allows user-space to order DAHDI to register them to specific 
span and channel numbers. This allows registering different spans out of
order.

.B dahdi_span_assignments
is used to register those spans or to help creating the configuration
file used in their registration:
.B /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf .

.SH OPTIONS

There are several sub-commands:

.B add \fIdevpath \fB[\fIdevpath \fB...]
.RS
Parameters are paths (in SysFS) to DAHDI devices with unregistered
spans. The command will register with DAHDI according to according to
configuration in \fBassigned-spans.conf\fR.
.RE

.B remove \fIdevpath \fB[\fIdevpath \fB...]
.RS
Parameters are paths (in SysFS) to DAHDI devices with registered
spans. The command will unregister with DAHDI.
.RE

.B auto
.RS
Register all non-registered spans. Each span registers to first
available span number and channel numbers, as if
\fBdahdi.auto_assign_span\fR was set.
.RE

.B list
.RS
List all spans in the system.
.RE

.B dumpconfig
.RS
List all registered spans in the system in a format fit to be used in
\fBassigned-spans.conf\fR. Use this to generate a configuration file after
you have (perhaps manually) registered all existing spans.

.B dahdi_genconf assignedspans
uses this command internally.
.RE

.B \-v \-\-verbose
.RS
Verbose output.
.RE

.B \-n \-\-dry\-run
.RS
Don't register / unregister spans. Only print commands used to do so.
.RE

.B \-k \fIkey
.RS
For \fBdumpconfig\fR \- The key by which to identify the hardware in the
generated configuration. Legal values:

.B hwid
.RS
Hardware identifier (e.g.: software-readable serial number). This is the
default. If the device has no hwid, devpath is used.
.RE

.B location
.RS
The location field (file) in the SysFS device node (directory) for the
DAHDI device. If not available (typically: DAHDI version <= 2.7.x),
devpath is used.
.RE

.B devpath
.RS
Path in SysFS to the device node.
.RE
.RE

.SH CONFIGURATOIN
.B assigned-spans.conf
is a file with lines specifying registration of spans.

Empty lines or lines beginning with '#' are ignored.

Each line is in the format of:

.I ID		spanspec ...

The \fIID\fR field specifies the DAHDI device and the \fIspanspecs\fR
define how to register its spans. A line may have multiple
\fIspanspecs\fR in a single line (though dumpconfig generates a
configuration with one per line).

.SS Span Identifier
A DAHDI device may be specified either by a hardware identifier (a
software readable serial number or whatever) or the location in which
it is installed on the system. The former makes it simpler to change
connector / slot whereas the latter makes it simpler to replace a unit.

The value in this field is matched (when the commands \fBadd\fR and
\fBremove\fR) are used) to the following values:

 \fIhwid\fR
 \fB@\fIlocation\fR
 \fIdevpath\fR

See above for their descriptions. The value may include shell wildcards:
*, ? and [], which are used in the match. The values to be matched are
first cleaned up: '!' is replaced with '/' and any character beyond
"a-zA-Z0-9/:.-" is removed.

.SS Span Specification

Each line should have one or more span specifications: this is the value
used to register a span with DAHDI in the SysFS interface. A
specification has three colon-separated numbers:

.I rel_span_no:span_no:first_chan

for instance, the following are four span specifications for a quad-E1
device: 1:6:53 2:7:84 3:8:115 4:9:146 occupying spans 6-9 and channels
53-176.

.B rel_span_no
.RS
The relative number of the span in the device. E.g.: port number.
.RE

.B span_no
.RS
The desired DAHDI span number. Must be available.
.RE

.B first_chan
.RS
The desired DAHDI channel number for the first DAHDI channel in the span.
All channels of the span will be registered following it and hence that
space must be available.
.RE


.SH ENVIRONMENT

.B DAHDICONFDIR
.RS
The directory in which assigned-spans.conf resides. /etc/dahdi if not
overridden from the environment.
.RE

.B DAHDISASSIGNEDSPANSCONF
.RS
The path to assigned-spans.conf resides. /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf if
not overridden from the environment.
.RE

.B SPAN_ASSIGNMENTS_KEY
.RS
The default value for \-k . Defaults to "hwid" if not overridden from the
environment.
.RE


.SH FILES

.B /etc/dahdi/assigned-spans.conf
.RS
The default location for the configuration file.
.RE

.B /sys/bus/dahdi_devices/devices/\fIdevice\fR
.RS
SysFS node for the device. In this directory reside the following
files, among others:

.B location
.RS
The value of the device's location field.
.RE

.B assign_span, unassign_span, auto_assign
.RS
Write only files for the operations. Used by \fBadd\fR, \fBremove\fR and
\fBauto\fR, respectively.
.RE
